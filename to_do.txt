- check character count warning
- css so it actually looks right
- investigate autofill not liking spaces (probable solution: put quotes around autofill filling in template)
- get favicon so http stops bugging me about it
- change default editor in dropdown depending on current editor

- parent: 
    - title
    - "diy box/paint-by-numbers grid" option + submit
    - {% block %} w/ basic text box option as default
    - results box

- child: 
    - grid dimensions inputs
    - autofill textbox
